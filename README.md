Canasta
=======

To keep up with my skills and since I can't find anyone to play with me, I'm creating a program to play the card game, Canasta, all from scratch! This is one of my goals for the summer. I will be using C++ and OpenGL 2.0.

Commands
--------  
* Run `make` to create the main executable and testsuite executable. 
  * Run `canasta` for the main program
  * Run `testsuit` for eror reporting.
